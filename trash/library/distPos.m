%DISTPOS Distance from a box
%
%   DISTPOS(w, l) builds the function
%
%       g(x) = sum(w_i*(x_i - max{l_i, x_i}))
%
%   Boundaries l_i can take the value -inf, in which case the corresponding
%   halfline is lower unbounded.
%
%   Weights w_i are assumed to be 1 if not provided. They can take the
%   value +inf, in which case the distance from the corresponding halfline
%   [l_i,+inf] becomes the indicator function.
