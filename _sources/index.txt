ForBES (Forward-Backward Envelope Solver) is a MATLAB solver for
**convex**, **nonconvex**, **nonsmooth** optimization problems. It is generic in the sense that the user
can customize the problem to solve in an easy and flexible way. It is efficient
since it features very efficient algorithms, suited for large scale applications.

ForBES is open source and `available on GitHub`_.

In the figure: performance of ForBES compared to other well known algorithms
on a Lasso problem with 3K observations and 500K features,
for a total of 7.5M nonzero coefficients.
