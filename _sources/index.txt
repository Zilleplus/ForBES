Welcome to ForBES
=================

ForBES (Forward-Backward Envelope Solver) is a MATLAB solver for
nonsmooth optimization problems. It is generic in the sense that the user
can customize the problem to solve in an easy and flexible way. It is efficient
since it features very efficient algorithms, suited for large scale applications.

In the figure is a performance comparison between ForBES, the fast forward-backward
splitting method (also known as fast proximal gradient method) and ADMM
(alternating direction method of multipliers), applied to a Lasso problem with
3K observations and 500K features, for a total of 7.5M nonzero coefficients.

ForBES is open source and `available on GitHub`_.
