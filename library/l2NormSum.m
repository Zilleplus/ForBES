%L2NORMSUM Allocates the sum-of-L2-norm function.
%
%   L2NORMSUM(m, mu) builds the function
%       
%       g(x) = mu*sum(||x_i||_2)
%
%   where x_i are blocks of size m of vector x. If mu is not provided it is
%   assumed mu = 1. If also m is not provided, then m = 1 and the function
%   is the L1 norm.
