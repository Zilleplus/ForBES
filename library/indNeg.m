%INDNEG Indicator function of the negative orthant.
%
%   INDNEG(u) builds the function
%
%       g(x) = 0    if x_i <= u_i for all i
%            = +inf otherwise
%
%   Argument u is either a scalar or a vector of the same size of x. If
%   argument u is not given, then u = 0. If any u_i is +inf then the
%   corresponding halfline [-inf, u_i] is unbounded.
