%INDPOS Indicator function of the positive orthant.
%
%   INDPOS(l) builds the function
%       
%       g(x) = 0    if x_i >= l_i for all i
%            = +inf otherwise
%
%   Argument l is either a scalar or a vector of the same size of x. If
%   argument l is not given, then l = 0. If any l_i is +inf then the
%   corresponding halfline [l_i, +inf] is unbounded.
