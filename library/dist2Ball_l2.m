%DIST2BALL_L2 Squared distance from a Euclidean ball of given center and radius
%
%   DIST2BALL_L2(rho, c, w) builds the function
%       
%       f(x) = (w/2)*dist^2(x,B) where B is the ball ||x-c|| <= rho
%
%   If c is not provided, c = 0. If also rho is not provided, rho = 1.
%   Default weight is w = 1.
